This is a simple express app with a boilerplate user system that you can build an app off of. It uses jade templating for the html pages. Feel free to clone it.

## Installation

Once you've cloned it, open two windows in your terminal. Go to the cloned folder and run npm install. 

Then run mongod to get the database running.

In the next window go to the cloned folder and run nodemon app.js to load the page to locallhost:3000.
